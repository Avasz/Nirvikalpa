<h2>Features of Artha</h2>
<p>Artha is a handy thesaurus that focuses on high usability, without trading off simplicity and ease of use. It has the following distinct features that increases its usability: </p>
<dl>
<dt>WordNet</dt>
<dd>Artha harnesses the extensive & in-depth database provided by WordNet. Unlike other dictionaries which goes on-line for every single lookup, Artha works completely off-line; thanks to WordNet for its excellent and cognitive database.</dd>
<dt>Hot key Lookup</dt>
<dd>When you press a pre-set hot key, after selecting some text on any window, Artha pops up with the selection's definitions looked-up.</dd>
<dt>Regular Expressions Search</dt>
<dd>When a word is vaguely known I.e. the user is unclear of its spelling or when it's start/end alone is known or when the number of characters is known; one can speed up/narrow the search using regular expression to locate the particular word they have in mind.</dd>
<dt>Notifications</dt>
<dd>Artha can show passive notifications (balloon tips) instead of the application's window popping up, so that you can continue what you were doing, uninterrupted. (like reading, writing, etc.)</dd>
<dt>Suggestions</dt>
<dd>When a misspelled word is queried for, Artha gives you its near-match suggestions.</dd>
<dt>Relative to Sense Mapping</dt>
<dd>Relative words like synonyms, antonyms, etc. that are displayed are many. You might not know to which sense/definition of a word does a relative map to. In Artha, when you select a relative, its corresponding definition is scrolled to and highlighted for easy comprehension. </dd>

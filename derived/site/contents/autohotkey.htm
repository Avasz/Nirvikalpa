<h2>About AutoHotKey 1.0.48.05</h2>
<p>AutoHotkey is a scripting language primarily used to automate various Windows tasks by allowing you to send simulated keystrokes and/or mouse clicks to any Windows application. AutoHotkey
scripts can also display dialog boxes, menus and data entry forms to interact with the user. AutoHotKey scripts can run in Windows 98/Me/2000/XP and can be converted into EXE files
that can be run on computers that don't have AutoHotkey installed.</p>
<p>An typical example where AutoHotKey is used is to automate the install of an application by sending keystrokes and mouse clicks to the application installer. You can use the script to auto install the application on other machines without you having to manually click on Next, Next, Next, Agree to License, enter installation path, etc).</p>

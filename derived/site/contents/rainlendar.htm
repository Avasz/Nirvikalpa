<h2>About Rainlendar 0.22.1</h2>
<p>Rainlendar is a customisable calendar that resides on your desktop and shows the days of the current month. You can also add events to the calendar as well as maintain a to-do list which can also be displayed on the desktop.</p>
<p>The calendar can use different skins to fit your taste (and theme). You can use different fonts and colors, select the background image or even make the calendar's background transparent.</p>
<p>Rainlendar is developed and tested for Windows XP. It should work on Win98/ME, even though they are not officially supported.</p>

<h2>About Qliner Hotkeys 2.0.1</h2>
<p>Qliner hotkeys is a keyboard productivity environment for Windows XP, Windows 2003 server and Vista. It allows you to easily view and edit your Windows hotkey combinations. Windows hotkey combinations are the Windows key, followed by another key on the keyboard. For example, pressing the Windows key, holding it down while pressing the "E" key brings up Windows Explorer.</p>
<p>With Qliner hotkeys, holding the Windows key down for three seconds brings up an on-screen keyboard where you can view your hotkey combinations and edit/create new ones.</p>

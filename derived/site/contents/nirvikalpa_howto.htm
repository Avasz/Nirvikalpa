<h2>How to use Nirvikalpa CD 3.0-&beta;1</h2>
<p>The Nirvikalpa CD 3.0-&beta;1 offers a web based interface for you to browse the collection of open source software for Windows.</p>
<p>The webpages use <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> and Javascript for showing and hiding sections. While such pages are viewable in any browser,
the full functionality of the interface may not be available in older browsers. To take full advantage of the Nirvikalpa CD 3.0-&beta;1 web page interface, you should use either :
<dl>
<dt>Mozilla Firefox (<a href="software/internet/mozilla firefox/Firefox Setup 3.5.2.exe">Download from Nirvikalpa CD 3.0-&beta;1</a>) <b>(recommended)</b></dt><dd>This is included on the Nirvikalpa CD 3.0-&beta;1. It is recommended that you install the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/207" title="OpenDownload Homepage on the internet">OpenDownload</a> extension that allows you to open ANY file (such as executables) directly without having to save the file first to your hard disk to launch it. With this extension, you can "run" the program installer directly from the Nirvikalpa CD 3.0-&beta;1.</dd>
<dt><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ie">Microsoft Internet Explorer 6</a></dt>
<dd>With the new security features in Windows XP Service Pack 2, Internet Explorer will initially restrict the webpages on the Nirvikalpa CD 3.0-&beta;1 from "showing active content" . The "active content" is the Javascript used for the web interface. For full functionality, allow such content to run</dd>
<dt><a href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera</a></dt>
<dd>This freeware web browser also has many features in a small download.</dd>

<p>Here is a screenshot of the web based interface:</p>

</div>
<p>Each program has its own web page with the following sections:
<ul>
<li>a short introduction describing what the program does.</li>
<li>a screenshot of the program.</li>
<li>the features of the program.</li>
<li>related web links which contain useful information, tutorials, discussion forums. You will need to be online to access these links.</li>
</ul>
<p>From the program's page, you can install the program from the Nirvikalpa CD 3.0-&beta;1 and visit the homepage of the program (if you are online) in order to access the latest information, for example, program updates.</p>
<p>On the left side of the page are the program categories (Desktop Applications, Educational, etc.) and the "About the Nirvikalpa CD 3.0-&beta;1" section. Clicking on these sections will open a submenu containing the programs and related links for that section.</p>

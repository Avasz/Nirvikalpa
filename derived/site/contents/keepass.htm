<h2>Features of KeePass 1.17</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Highly encrypted databases.</dt>
<dd>KeePass supports Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and the Twofish algorithms to encrypt its password databases. The entire database is encrypted, not just password fields. Even while im memory, the passwords are encrypted so that passwords wouldn't be found in the Windows cache.</dd>
<dt>Support of master passwords and key-disks</dt>
<dd>One master password decrypts the complete database. Alternatively, you can use key-disks. Key-disks provide better security than master passwords in most cases. You only have to carry the key-file with you, for example on a floppy disk, or you can burn it on CD. Or you can use a combination of these methods.</dd>
<dt>Export password list to TXT, HTML, XML or CSV files.</dt>
<dt>You can attach files to password entries (useful to store PGP signature files in KeePass for example).</dt>

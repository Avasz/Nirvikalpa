<h2>About Paint.NET 3.36</h2>
<p>Paint.NET is image and photo manipulation software designed to be used on computers that run XP, Server 2003 and Vista. It started development at Washington State University as an undergraduate senior design project mentored by Microsoft, and is currently being maintained by some of the alumni that originally worked on it. It is meant to be a free replacement for the MS Paint software that comes with all Windows operating systems. The programming language used to create Paint.NET is C#.</p>
<p>Paint.NET has many of the powerful features that expensive commercial applications have, including the ability to use layers.</p>

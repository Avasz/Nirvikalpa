<h2>What is Open Source Software?</h2>
<p>Open Source Software is software for which the "guts" of the program can be freely downloaded and altered to suit your needs (provided you can do the programming). There are many types of Open Source Software. The difference lies in the way altered versions of the software can be distributed, so if you customise the software for your own needs, then decide to distribute it, you may be bound by specific terms.</p>
<p>Many such open source projects make ready to install executable versions for various operating systems including Windows.
<p>You can do the following with open source software :
<ul>
<li>install the software on any number of machines in any environment (home or commercial) without purchasing licence fees for each machine</li>
<li>obtain and modify the source code and distribute modified versions of the program together with the modified source code. Many open source licenses differ in how such source code can be distributed or licensed for others to also do what you have done.</li>
</ul>

<dd>The definition of Free software (defined by the Free Software Foundation (FSF)) The word "free" refers to freedom, not price.<br>
While "free software" meets the definition of open source software, not all open source software meets the free software definition. See also</p>
